# Who and Why
My name is Jaylen Hayden, a Year Up United student who was tasked with creating an accounting ledger application for our capstone project. This application demonstrates
my understanding of the course learnings so far and my ability to problem solve and come up with solutions.

# What it does
This is a ledger application that allows the user to track financial transactions. All functions of the software can be accessed via the three menu screens below.
